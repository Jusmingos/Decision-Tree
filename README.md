# Decision-Tree
This project implements the ID3 algorithm of decision tree learning. The algorithm first trains the program with a data set (the ones labeled training), and then tests it with another non-overlapping 
data set(the ones labeled testing). After the training, the program makes a binary classification for the testing data.
